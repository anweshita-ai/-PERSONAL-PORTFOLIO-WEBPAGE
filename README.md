### **Task Description: Personal Portfolio Website – Serafina's Portfolio**

The task is to create a **personal portfolio website** that highlights an individual's skills, projects, and contact information in a creative yet professional way. The project, called **"Serafina’s Portfolio"**, is built using **HTML5 and CSS3**. It follows responsive design principles and features stylish layouts, smooth animations, and a focus on personal branding. This portfolio serves as a digital resume and a creative display for a front-end developer.

The site is visually appealing, employs a soft pastel color scheme, and includes several well-organized sections such as Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. A fixed navigation bar improves usability by allowing easy navigation across the site through anchor links.

### **Technologies and Tools Used**

1. **HTML5**  
   HTML5 forms the basic structure of the site. It defines semantic sections like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and form elements for the contact section. The content is well-organized and friendly for search engines.

2. **CSS3**  
   CSS handles styling, layout, responsive design, and animations. It includes:

   * **CSS Variables (`:root`)** for managing themes
   * **Custom fonts** from Google Fonts (`Quicksand` and `Playfair Display`)
   * **Responsive media queries** for mobile compatibility
   * **Hover and transition effects** for buttons, skills, and project cards
   * **Animations** like `fadeIn` to enhance appearance

3. **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**  
   A small script is added to manage the visibility of a “Back to Top” button that appears after the user scrolls down. It uses `window.onscroll` to show or hide the button based on the scroll position.

4. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
   The development process took place in **VS Code**, a lightweight and efficient code editor. Extensions like Live Server, Prettier, and IntelliSense were probably used for real-time previewing and formatting.

### **Key Features of the Website**

* **Responsive Navigation Bar:**  
  A sticky header offers smooth scrolling links to each section for easy navigation.

* **Animated Hero Section:**  
  The Home section includes a welcoming message and description, animated with a fade-in effect for an elegant entrance.

* **About Section:**  
  This section provides a personal introduction and creative background, giving potential clients or employers insight into the developer’s character and approach.

* **Skills Showcase:**  
  Displays a card-like layout where each skill (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Figma) is visually highlighted with hover effects and soft accent colors.

* **Project Gallery:**  
  Showcases several projects with brief descriptions and technology stacks. Each project is presented in a stylish container that scales on hover to attract attention.

* **Contact Section with Form:**  
  Features a functional form for users to send messages and links to social media platforms such as GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram. This section promotes networking and collaboration.

* **Back to Top Button:**  
  A circular floating button appears when scrolling and provides a smooth scroll back to the top, enhancing navigation.

* **Footer:**  
  Includes a personalized closing message, a subtle branding line, and copyright notice.

   Great for designers, developers, freelancers, and creatives to showcase their work online.

2. **Job Applications:**  
   Acts as a digital resume that candidates can share with potential employers or clients.
